Langchecker
===========

Code to replicate the langchecker feature on [webdashboard](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/webdashboard).

To set it up, rename the file ```config/settings.inc.php.ini``` as ```config/settings.inc.php```, and indicate in this file the local paths to the various SVN and GitHub repositories the application tracks.

Then install dependencies (composer install).

See [wiki](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/langchecker/wiki) for further details.
